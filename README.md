# PD rockets

PD rockets is a collection of vendorable components built with [Rocket](https://data-star.dev/reference/rocket),
Datastar's open-source web component API. Drag-and-drop is the first family: a multi-list drag group, Kanban,
sortable-list, bento-grid and file-tree surfaces are working examples, alongside a contextual action menu. A server
renders light DOM; Rocket owns browser interaction and emits semantic events; the page connects those events to its
Datastar actions and backend handlers.

- `contracts/` — DOM inputs, keyboard defaults, and semantic event outputs.
- `core/` — pointer lifecycle, drag preview, and FLIP mechanics.
- `rocket/` — custom-element lifecycle and domain-specific target geometry.
- `examples/hono-datastar/` — JSX event bindings and a local DOM demo.
- `examples/go/` — Go templates, Datastar actions, and SSE morphs.
- `site/` — a static guide and live examples backed by an in-browser SSE fixture.

`pd-drag-group` coordinates multiple `[data-drop-list]` regions containing `[data-drag-item]` elements. Pointer
dragging or Alt + arrows (or h/j/k/l) emits `pd-drag-group-move` with `{ itemId, fromList, toList, before }`;
releasing Alt commits a keyboard move, and Escape cancels it. Groups are independent. Kanban keeps its own column and
card contract while sharing the insertion and pointer mechanics.

`pd-context-menu` is a template-first, backend-neutral action menu. Server-rendered items and nested submenus are
cloned on open with a target `contextId`; the menu handles popover placement, keyboard navigation, and focus return,
then emits `{ action, contextId }`. The page owns action handling and may morph the template with fresh server HTML.
An action closes the menu by default. Add `data-menu-keep-open` to an action or an enclosing menu when several actions
must remain available until light dismiss, Escape, or `closeMenu()` closes the menu.
For fetched menu fragments, render a direct child marked `data-pd-menu-content` instead of a template and call
`openFor(trigger)` after the page installs the fragment. `closeMenu(refocus?)` and `isOpen()` expose the lifecycle;
`pd-menu-scope` emits `{ root, active }` for page-owned keyboard scopes. Live content remains in the DOM on close.

`pd-inline-edit` owns a title's double-press detection, Enter/blur commit, and Escape cancellation while the page
owns its input, edit mode, validation and save. Mark title and input with `data-inline-edit-trigger` / `data-inline-edit-value`
and `data-inline-edit-input`; the host emits request, commit and cancel events with an opaque `contextId`.

`pd-bento-workspace` is an experimental two-grid dashboard surface. It reuses the pointer and FLIP lifecycle, but
uses cell coordinates and spans instead of list insertion targets. It calculates a transient, animated layout and emits
all changed positions on move or resize. The backend applies those positions and returns the confirmed HTML; the guide's
in-browser SSE fixture demonstrates that handoff without duplicating placement logic. The consuming page provides CSS
Grid tracks (`grid-template-columns` and a fixed `grid-auto-rows`) for pointer-to-cell geometry.

`core/board-geometry.ts` provides board-specific lane/grid-track hit testing and remove-then-insert ordering for
variable-height cards. `core/board-projection.ts` calculates disposable CSS placement overrides for held or staged
cards. These pure helpers do not read application state or move DOM nodes; a consuming board supplies its own move
lifecycle and places the generated rules after server-rendered layout styles. Multiple boards can pass a trusted host
selector to scope the rules. Linear lists continue to use
`core/insertion-target.ts`.
`installBoardProjection()` is the browser half: the page supplies current holds and an optional staged preview through
callbacks. It reasserts only those cards across full morphs, marking persistence state, moving held cards between lanes
when CSS alone cannot, and keeping its override style after server truth and outside a morph region if the page placed it
there. Request dispatch, confirmation, and retry
policy stay with the page.
`installBoardDrag()` supplies lane-grid pointer capture, keep-in-place previews, hit testing and a morph-tolerant drag
lifecycle. Cards use `data-board-card`, lanes use `data-board-lane` / `data-col`, and the explicit grip uses
`data-pd-board-drag-handle`. A direct child `<template data-pd-preview>` can supply the page's preview markup
and CSS (with `--pd-source-width` / `--pd-source-height` available); otherwise a non-interactive card clone is
used. The page provides selection, semantic intents and projection indicators through callbacks. Optional
`data-pd-board-drop-zone="<column id>"` affordances can represent the same destination in another part of the board:
CSS controls which copies are visible, and the kit hit-tests the visible one, marks all copies of its destination with
`data-pd-board-drop-over`, and appends a dropped card to that lane. `onCommit` receives the hit zone as its final argument
so the page can reveal a destination if desired. Tabs, pagers, responsive breakpoints and command policy stay with the
page.
`installBoardColumnReorder()` is likewise opt-in: the page marks its desktop heads with `data-pd-board-column`,
mobile tabs with `data-pd-board-mobile-column`, their handles with `data-pd-board-column-grip` (and
`data-pd-board-mobile-grip` for tabs), and optional accessible steps with `data-pd-board-column-step`. It
produces only `(columnId, toIndex)`; the page renders and orders the columns and owns the command.
`installBoardCamera()` optionally scrolls the page or the lane under a dragged pointer at the viewport edge and calls
back after settling so the page can remeasure its drop target. The page supplies live lane queries and drag state; it
can omit the camera entirely or keep its own mobile scrolling affordance.

`pd-sortable-tree` is a folder/file list with between-sibling insertion and drops into folders. Its
`pd-tree-move` detail carries `{ itemId, fromParent, toParent, before }`; the backend applies that change and sends
rendered HTML over SSE. Pointer drops animate the dragged row from the floating preview's final position.

Every surface supports arrow-key and Vim-key focus navigation. Home/End navigate list, group, grid and tree items;
Alt + arrows or Alt + h/j/k/l stage moves, and Escape cancels staging. Bento also supports Shift + arrows for resizing
and Alt + PageUp/PageDown for switching grids. The file tree presents compact explorer-style rows rather than cards.
Nested Rocket hosts are supported: the nearest host owns each pointer or keyboard gesture. The guide includes a live
sortable list inside a drag-group item, with independent server-rendered move responses for each host. Semantic events
still bubble; page handlers on nested hosts with the same event name should check the event target.

Keyboard intents are configured on each host using `data-key-<intent>` attributes. Values are space-separated shortcuts
such as `data-key-focus-next="ArrowDown n"`; an empty value disables that intent. The shared focus intents are
`focus-next`, `focus-previous`, `focus-left`, `focus-right`, `focus-first`, and `focus-last`; moves use `move-up`,
`move-down`, `move-left`, and `move-right`, plus `cancel`. Each surface exposes only the directions it supports.
Bento also exposes `resize-up/down/left/right` and `grid-previous/next`. Kanban continues to accept its original
`data-key-select-next/previous/left/right` names; the corresponding `data-key-focus-*` attribute takes precedence.
All surface defaults live in `core/keyboard.ts`, with the Kanban compatibility defaults in `contracts/kanban.ts`.
Every surface with previous/next focus navigation also accepts macOS `Ctrl+p` / `Ctrl+n` by default; other platforms
leave those browser shortcuts available unless the host opts in. Editable descendants keep their native text shortcuts.

The reusable client does not know about application actions, persistence, permissions, or transport policy. Rocket
provides the component boundary and lifecycle for local browser mechanics, while Datastar handles actions and HTML
updates. See the [Rocket reference](https://data-star.dev/reference/rocket) for the upstream API.

## Install prebuilt browser bundles

Custom-element tags, emitted events, data hooks, CSS variables, and bundle names use the `pd-` prefix. When updating
from an older bundle, update markup, event bindings, CSS selectors, import maps, and script URLs together. The browser
bundles use the external `pd-rockets/runtime` specifier for the one upstream Datastar + Rocket instance.

Tagged releases publish `pd-rockets-browser.tar.gz` with minified PD rockets JavaScript bundles, matching Brotli
`.js.br` files, generated TypeScript declarations under `types/`, and their Beer-Ware license. The declarations are
generated from the same source revision as the bundles; `types/manifest.json` records their SHA-256 digests.
The guide lists the Brotli size beside each bundle download.
Release tags use UTC dates: `vYYYY-MM-DD` for the first release of a day and `vYYYY-MM-DD-2`, `-3`, etc. for later
releases that day. Pin a specific tag and verify the archive digest when vendoring; `releases/latest` follows future tags.
Replace `<owner>/<repo>` with the published GitHub repository:

```sh
mkdir -p public/js && curl -fsSL "https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/releases/latest/download/pd-rockets-browser.tar.gz" | tar -xz -C public/js
```

Choose a single surface or the full collection:

| File                    | Use                                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pd-core.js`            | Import framework-neutral pointer, insertion, keyboard and FLIP helpers. |
| `pd-kanban.js`          | Kanban board.                                                           |
| `pd-sortable-list.js`   | One sortable list.                                                      |

| `pd-sortable-tree.js`   | Folder/file tree.                                                       |
| `pd-kit.js`             | All surfaces.                                                           |

Each surface bundle includes the core code it needs; `pd-core.js` is for direct imports, not a required second
script. The surface bundles import `rocket` from the external `pd-rockets/runtime` specifier. Map it to the open-source
[`datastar-rocket.js` bundle](https://data-star.dev/reference/rocket#bundle) before loading a surface:

```html
<script type="importmap">
  { "imports": { "pd-rockets/runtime": "/js/datastar-rocket.js" } }
</script>
<script type="module" src="/js/pd-sortable-tree.js"></script>
```

TypeScript consumers of the full bundle can map its browser specifier to the extracted declaration entry (for example,
`"paths": { "/js/pd-kit.js": ["./public/js/types/client-entry.d.ts"] }` in `tsconfig.json`). This checks installer
options and return types without bundling TypeScript into the browser.

The pinned upstream bundle includes both Datastar and Rocket, so the guide loads it without a separate `datastar.js`.
If an application uses separate scripts, map `pd-rockets/runtime` to a Rocket ES module exporting `rocket` that uses the
same Datastar instance; a standalone Datastar script by itself does not provide Rocket. Upstream v1.0.4 currently
publishes Rocket in the combined bundle. Keep its upstream MIT notice with the runtime; the PD rockets release archive
does not include it.

Rocket explicitly supports `setup` without `render` for server-owned light DOM. Those hosts may receive new Datastar
issuers during morphs. The pinned open-source Rocket bundle
dispatches newly scoped descendants by finding their nearest Rocket host, as verified by
`tests/browser/rocket-scope.pw.ts`. A consumer runtime that looks up ownership only on the issuer itself must refresh
that ownership on every scope update; otherwise a newly morphed `@dispatchRocket` issuer silently misses its action.
That is a runtime dispatch/scoping issue, not a board behavior contract. A page can temporarily call Rocket's renderless
`render()` after child additions to refresh ownership, but the kit does not install an observer for the pinned runtime.
Serve the `.js` files normally; precompressed `.js.br` files are optional for servers configured to negotiate Brotli
and send `Content-Encoding: br` with a JavaScript content type. Do not reference `.js.br` in a script tag.

## Build and run locally

```sh
bun install
bun run serve:site
```

Open `http://localhost:4173`. `bun run build:client` produces the standalone and combined browser artifacts in `dist/`, and
`bun run bundle:browser` creates the release archive locally. The site build fetches the pinned open-source runtime into
ignored `public/js/`, verifies its SHA-256 and publishes it alongside the tracked upstream MIT notice.
After bundling, `bun run test:consumer` extracts the archive into an isolated fixture, verifies every declaration digest,
typechecks a generic board against the shipped declarations, and checks that the bundle imports the external Rocket runtime.
The release workflow runs this smoke test before publishing.

To publish a browser bundle, run formatting, typecheck, unit/browser tests and both demo smoke tests, review the release
tree, then push a clean `main` branch. Run `bun run release:tag` on that branch. The command fetches remote tags, confirms
local `main` matches `origin/main`, creates the next UTC date tag with a neutral author, and pushes it. The tag workflow
rejects other tag formats and attaches the built archive to the GitHub release. The previous `v0.1.0` release stays
available for existing consumers; new releases use date tags.

The site build writes `dist/site`, a relative-path static artifact suitable for GitHub Pages. The home page is a
component catalog; `documentation/` contains focused component and guide pages, and `guide.html` preserves the
long-form guide and its section links. Its in-browser fixture
intercepts the demo actions and returns `datastar-patch-elements` SSE responses, exercising the same morph path
without an application server. The Pages workflow publishes this artifact on pushes to `main`; the guide's source links
use a generated, browsable copy of the public project files that also works when served locally. A bounded activity
queue shows synthetic Rocket events, demo action POSTs and SSE patch responses without displaying item text or request
bodies.

For a quick Chromium interaction run, install Playwright's browser once with `bunx playwright install chromium`, then
run `bun run test:browser`. Playwright starts a small synthetic fixture server, bundles the source once per run, and uses
four workers. Run a focused case with `bunx playwright test -g 'nested'`; `bun run test` retains the Bun unit tests.

Run `bun run test:perf` for an informational Chromium benchmark of all five surfaces. It adds synthetic items to the
browser fixture, warms each interaction, and prints p50/p95 handler times (milliseconds) for focus navigation, staged
moves, stationary pointer previews, and changing pointer targets. The timings cover synchronous event dispatch; they
exclude network, animation, and browser painting, and are not CI pass/fail thresholds.

To run the Hono JSX demo instead:

```sh
bun run demo
```

Then open `http://localhost:3025`. Its Hono handlers apply semantic moves to in-memory state and return HTML patches
over SSE.

To run the Go demo after `bun run runtime:fetch && bun run build:client`:

```sh
cd examples/go
go run .
```

Then open `http://localhost:3035`. It renders the same fixture, binds semantic events to Datastar actions, and
returns SSE element patches from Go handlers.
